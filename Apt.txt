Apt
===

Apt is the pacakge handling system of debian and its derivatives, like ubuntu.

Adding and removing packages
----------------------------

In the config file, instruct metaconfig to install certain pacakages, and to remove certain packages (if they are installed).

[apt]
install += "somepackage"
install += ["a", "list", "of", "packages"]

remove += "Someotherpackage"
remove += ["a", "list", "of", "packages", "no", "to", "be", "on", "the", "system"]

If bad package names are used, metaconfig will return with an error.

Note that, before installing, metaconfig will update the repositories (as in run "apt-get update")


Adding apt keys (from Metaconfig_mozrepo/service/iceweasel_latest_esr/config)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apt repositories has signing keys, and metaconfig will normal√¶y fail if packages cannot be validated.

[apt.source.debian_mozilla]
url = "http://mozilla.debian.net/"
dist = "wheezy-backports"
components = ["iceweasel-esr"]
keys += "A6AA8C72"

TODO: how to find these keys?
